# Project Constitution - Phase II

## Core Principles

1. **Full-Stack Development**: Integrate both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Next.js) applications.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
3. **Database Integration**: Use SQLite for persistent data storage with proper ORM integration.
4. **API Design**: Follow RESTful API principles with proper error handling and validation.
5. **Security First**: Implement security measures from the ground up, including JWT-based authentication.
6. **Test-Driven Development**: Maintain high test coverage for all components.

## Development Guidelines

- All changes must follow the SDD (Specification Driven Development) workflow
- Use AI agents for generating code and configuration files
- Maintain consistency between specifications and implementations
- Follow security-first practices in all implementations
- Ensure automated testing for all components

## Quality Standards

- All APIs must be validated against specifications
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all services
- Maintain clear separation of concerns in architecture

## Decision-Making Process

- Technical decisions must be documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Major changes require specification updates before implementation
- Peer review required for all code changes
- Rollback procedures must be defined for all deployments
