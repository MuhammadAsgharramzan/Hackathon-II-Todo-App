# Project Constitution - Todo App Hackathon II

## Core Principles

1. **Multi-Phase Development**: Implement the todo app in distinct phases (I-IV) with clear objectives for each phase.
2. **Specification Driven Development**: All features and changes must be specified before implementation.
3. **AI Integration**: Gradually integrate AI capabilities throughout the application stack.
4. **Security First**: Implement security measures at every phase of development.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Build upon previous phases with iterative enhancements.
6. **Open Source Collaboration**: Foster collaborative development practices.

## Development Guidelines

- All changes must follow the SDD (Specification Driven Development) workflow
- Use AI agents for generating code and configuration files
- Maintain consistency between specifications and implementations
- Follow security-first practices in all implementations
- Ensure backward compatibility between phases when possible

## Quality Standards

- All implementations must be validated against specifications
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all services
- Maintain clear separation of concerns in architecture

## Decision-Making Process

- Technical decisions must be documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Major changes require specification updates before implementation
- Peer review required for all code changes
- Rollback procedures must be defined for all deployments

## Phase-Specific Guidelines

### Phase I
- CLI-based todo application
- Focus on core functionality
- Specification-driven foundation

### Phase II
- Full-stack web application
- Authentication and user management
- Database integration

### Phase III
- AI agent integration
- LangGraph workflow orchestration
- Enhanced user experience

### Phase IV
- Containerization and orchestration
- Kubernetes deployment
- AI-assisted DevOps
