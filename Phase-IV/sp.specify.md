# Specification: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot (Phase IV)

## 1. Introduction
This specification outlines the requirements for deploying the Phase III Todo Chatbot application to a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube). This phase focuses on achieving "Cloud Native" status through proper containerization and orchestration, strictly following an AI-First / No-Code approach.

## 2. System Architecture
The system will consist of the following containerized components running within a Kubernetes cluster:
- **Frontend Pods**: Next.js application serving the UI.
- **Backend Pods**: FastAPI application handling API requests and AI agent logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted internally or externally, to be decided in plan). For verification simplicity, we may stick to SQLite if persistent volume claims (PVCs) handle it, or preferably verify with a proper PG setup if resources allow. *Constraint Checklist: The constitution specifies "Backend API reachable", implies full functionality.*
- **Ingress/Service**: Mechanisms to expose the application to the host machine.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **FR-01 Containerization**:
    - Backend must be containerized (Docker).
    - Frontend must be containerized (Docker).
    - Images must be optimized and versioned.
- **FR-02 Orchestration**:
    - Application must run on Minikube.
    - Deployment must be managed via Helm Charts.
    - Configuration must be decoupled from code (ConfigMaps/Secrets).
- **FR-03 Connectivity**:
    - Frontend must be able to talk to Backend within the cluster.
    - Host machine must be able to access Frontend (Browser) and Backend (API).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-01 Reproducibility**: All deployment artifacts (Dockerfiles, Manifests, Charts) must be generated by AI tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai).
- **NFR-02 Automation**: Deployment process should be scriptable or documented clearly.

## 5. Constraints & Compliance (Constitution)
- **Local Only**: Minikube.
- **No Manual Coding**: All key artifacts generated by AI.
- **Strict Workflow**: Spec -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implementation.

## 6. Success Metrics
- `kubectl get pods` shows all pods Running/Ready.
- Application accessible via `minikube service` or ingress URL.
- Chatbot successfully processes a request (e.g., "Add task") end-to-end.
