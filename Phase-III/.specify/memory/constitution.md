# Project Constitution - Phase III

## Core Principles

1. **AI Agent Integration**: Integrate AI agents for enhanced task processing and user interaction.
2. **LangGraph Architecture**: Use LangGraph for orchestrating AI agent workflows.
3. **Secure Implementation**: Maintain security standards while adding AI capabilities.
4. **User Experience Enhancement**: Improve user experience through intelligent automation.
5. **Scalable Design**: Design AI integration to scale with increasing user demands.
6. **Ethical AI Usage**: Implement AI features responsibly with appropriate safeguards.

## Development Guidelines

- All changes must follow the SDD (Specification Driven Development) workflow
- Use AI agents for generating code and configuration files
- Maintain consistency between specifications and implementations
- Follow ethical AI practices in all implementations
- Ensure proper error handling for AI interactions

## Quality Standards

- All AI integrations must be validated against specifications
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Follow responsible AI principles
- Maintain clear separation of concerns in architecture

## Decision-Making Process

- Technical decisions must be documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Major changes require specification updates before implementation
- Peer review required for all code changes
- Ethical AI considerations must be addressed for AI-related features
